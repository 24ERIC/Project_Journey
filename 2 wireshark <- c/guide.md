Packet Capture: Wireshark listens to a network connection in real time and then grabs entire streams of traffic â€“ quite possibly tens of thousands of packets at a time.
Filtering: Wireshark is capable of slicing and dicing all of this random live data using filters. By applying a filter, you can obtain just the information you need to see.
Visualization: Wireshark, like any good packet sniffer, allows you to dive right into the very middle of a network packet. It also allows you to visualize entire conversations and network streams.
