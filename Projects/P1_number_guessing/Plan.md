# Design
- get user input for range "range"
- generate a random number between range "target"
- new "count" count number of user's input
- for loop start
    - get user input "user_input"
        - "count" += 1
        - check if "user_input" == "target", if yes, return the "count"
    - modify the range
        - rule: split range into two
        - choose the one that include "target"
