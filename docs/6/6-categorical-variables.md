- Some of your features may be discrete values that arenâ€™t in an ordered relationship. Examples include breeds of dogs, words, or postal codes. These features are known as categorical and each value is called a category. You can represent categorical values as strings or even numbers, but you won't be able to compare these numbers or subtract them from each other.
